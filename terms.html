                                <h5 class="card-title">SHIPPING</h5>
                                <p class="text-muted">We offer FREE SHIPPING for all orders in Nepal.

                                    For international orders, we provide free shipping for all orders above USD 500. On orders less than USD 500, a shipping charge  will be applicable.<br>
                                    
                                    The estimated delivery time will differ with each order. Typically, we take around 3 to 4 business days to dispatch orders within Nepal, and 11 to 12 business days to dispatch international orders for our ready-to-wear lines.
                                    
                                    GSK Versatile wedding couture is made-to-order and takes 7 to 8 weeks for production and dispatch, depending on the garmentâ€™s design and style.
                                    
                                    Delivery within Nepal takes 2 to 3 business days and internationally takes 5 to 6 business days depending on the location and custom clearance in the destination country. Sometimes, delivery time is subject to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, unexpected travel delays from our courier partners due to weather conditions or any political disruptions or strikes. We promise to keep you updated at every step.
                                    
                                    Order collection from any of GSK Versatile retail outlets can be done upon request. Please contact our customer care for further assistance at goma@gskversatile.com.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">DUTIES AND TAXES</h5>
                                <p class="text-muted">All of GSK Versatile orders are shipped internationally from our warehouse in Lalitpur, Nepla to your provided shipping address. Due to the nature of international shipping, occasionally a customer may have to pay additional import duties and taxes which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. The large majority of orders will not have to pay any additional fees. However, we are unable to calculate when and how much these infrequent customs duty charges will be levied. In the case where additional customs charges are assessed, you will be responsible for paying these additional fees. GSK Versatile takes no responsibility for non-delivery of orders in case such taxes and duties are not accepted and settled by the recipient at the delivery address, and will not provide any refunds in such cases.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">EXCHANGES, RETURNS AND REFUNDS</h5>
                                <p class="text-muted">We want you to love what you purchase, but if something isnâ€™t right do let us know.

                                    In the unlikely event that something you ordered from gskversatile.com is damaged or defective, or if product delivered is different from what you had expected in size or style, you may return the product as we offer free returns.
